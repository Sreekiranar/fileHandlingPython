Abstract
Vison based tracking in aerial images has its own significance in the areas of both civil and defense
applications. A novel algorithm called aerial tracking learning detection which works on the basis of the popular
tracking learning detection algorithm to effectively track single and multiple objects in aerial images is proposed in
this study. Tracking learning detection (TLD) considers both appearance and motion features for tracking. It can
handle occlusion to certain extent, and can work well on long duration video sequences. However, when objects are
tracked in aerial images taken from platforms like unmanned air vehicle, the problems of frequent pose change, scale and illumination variations arise adding to low resolution, noise and jitter introduced by motion of the camera.
The proposed algorithm incorporates compensation for the camera movement, algorithmic modifications in
combining appearance and motion cues for detection and tracking of multiple objects and enhancements in the form
of inter object distance measure for improved performance of the tracker when there are many identical objects in
proximity. This algorithm has been tested on a large number of aerial sequences including benchmark videos, TLD
dataset and many classified unmanned air vehicle sequences and has shown better performance in comparison to
TLD.

1. Introduction
Vision system has become an integral part of military
applications, as in autonomous vehicles, where vision sensors
are deployed for missions like surveillance, tracking etc. In
particular, autonomous operation of unmanned air vehicles
(UAVs) has progressively developed in recent years wherein,
vision-based navigation, guidance and control has been the
most focused research interest for trajectory tracking, path
planning, obstacle avoidance, target localisation, target
recognition, border and ground surveillance.

Object tracking is a fundamental task in a wide range of
military and civilian applications, namely surveillance, traffic
monitoring and management, security and defense. In aerial
imagery applications, the camera system is mounted on a
moving aerial platform.
 
 
2. Related Work
  Initial study showed the existence of three main
techniques for object tracking, namely, point based, kernel
based and silhouette based tracking®. A system for tracking
moving objects in aerial images sequences taken from a
moving camera consists of motion compensation module,
motion detection followed by the tracking module.
